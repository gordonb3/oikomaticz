# Oikomaticz

Oikomaticz is a Home Automation System that is derived from [Domoticz](http://www.domoticz.com).

Unlike Domoticz, this project aims to be run on low power embedded systems rather than on Windows or
any other big CPU type system. As I don't own each and every bit of supported hardware myself part
of the code does remain mostly unaltered and changes inside the Domoticz repository are periodically
synced with these files.

Apart from code optimalization there are also some extended features such as:
 * support for city heat and water smart meter data
 * possibility to set `Day of with ECO` in Evohome (USB/TCP only)
 * native support for Harmony Hub
 * integrated local Tuya support for switching and energy monitoring
 * and more...
