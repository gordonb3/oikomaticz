# Oikomaticz

Oikomaticz is a Home Automation System that is derived from [Domoticz](http://www.domoticz.com).

Unlike Domoticz, this project is not meant to be run on Windows. The code base has been completely
restructured with included external projects moved to a different folder. The project's own files
have also been regrouped according to their functionality or operation level. Internally the methods
used by Oikomoticz mostly mirror that of Domoticz and for hardware that I do not own myself this
will likely stay that way.
