# Oikomaticz

Oikomaticz is a Home Automation System that is derived from [Domoticz](http://www.domoticz.com).

In contrast to Domoticz, this project aims to optimize for low power embedded systems rather than
rely on a big CPU type system. As I don't own each and every bit of supported hardware myself part
of the code does remain mostly unaltered (and thus less suitable for tiny machines). Changes to
the Domoticz repository are periodically reviewed and synced where possible

Apart from code optimalization there are also some extra features such as:
 * support for city heat and water smart meter data
 * possibility to set `Day of with ECO` in Evohome (USB/TCP only)
 * native support for Harmony Hub
 * integrated local Tuya support for switching and energy monitoring
 * integrated APSystems local ECU support for energy monitoring
 * and more...
