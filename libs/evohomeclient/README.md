# Evohomeclient

C++ hack to the Honeywell Evohome API

## Description

This project takes a lot of its ideas from watchforstock's Python based evohomeclient.

Reason for redeveloping this in C++ is that I run an implementation on a rather tiny machine and Python is quite heavy on resources. And slow. Of course, if you like the lib you can use it for any other project.

## Demo

There are several (simple) demos included in this project that show how the library can be used. Feel free to use whatever you like from these sources to build your own project using this library. Run ` make demo ` to build and check out these demos.

## Implementation

Looking for the Evohome client for Domoticz? I have moved that into it's own project [domoticz-evohomeclient](https://github.com/gordonb3/domoticz-evohomeclient)
