/*
 *	Client interface for local Tuya device access
 *
 *	This is the base TCP communication class for single device threads.
 *
 *	Both async and blocking mode (default) communication is supported,
 *	allowing straight forward single task applications to be created, as
 *	well as more advanced multi threaded monitoring applications.
 *
 *	Common functions:
 *	 - ConnectToDevice(hostname|IP_address)
 *		Opens a TCP connection with the device
 *		Returns true|false indicating success or failure
 *	 - send(buffer[], size)
 *		Sends `size` bytes of `buffer` to the device
 *		Returns `size` on success or -1 if an error occurred
 *	 - receive(buffer[], maxsize, minsize)
 *		Fills `buffer` with the device's response. The additional `minsize`
 *		parameter (used in blocking mode only) defaults to 30 to skip
 *		processing of empty responses that are returned on state changing
 *		commands.
 *		Returns number of bytes received or -1 if an error occurred
 *	 - disconnect()
 *		Closes the connection with the device
 *		Returns nothing
 *	 - getlasterror()
 *		Use this instead of referencing `errno`, which may be polluted
 *		Returns the last error state of the connection
 *
 *	Async functions:
 *	 - setAsyncMode(true|false)
 *		Enables (default) or disables async operation
 *		Returns nothing
 *	 - isConnected()
 *		Returns true|false indicating if connection was successful
 *	 - isSocketWritable()
 *		Returns true|false indicating if the connection is ready for writing
 *	 - isSocketReadable()
 *		Returns true|false indicating if the connection has data to be read
 *	 - getSocketState()
 *		Returns one of Tuya::TCP::Socket::value
 *	 - setSessionReady()
 *		Dummy function needed to be able to distinguish between being connected
 *		and session negotiation (API 3.4+) having been completed. Calling this
 *		method will set the SocketState to Tuya::TCP::Socket::READY from where
 *		it will alternate with Tuya::TCP::Socket::RECEIVING
 *		Does nothing if on call SocketState is not Tuya::TCP::Socket::CONNECTED
 *		Returns true|false 
 *
 *
 *	For either method, the connection requires periodic sending of a keep-alive
 *	signal. Upto a 15 second interval appears to be generally accepted. Client apps
 *	should call getSocketState() to decide what type of message the device will
 *	accept in this case:
 *	 - Tuya::TCP::Socket::READY
 *		=> data was received - you may ask for additional DPS updates
 *	 - Tuya::TCP::Socket::RECEIVING
 *		=> no data was received yet - you may only send a `HEARTBEAT` message
 *	Sending state changing commands can be done at any point in time
