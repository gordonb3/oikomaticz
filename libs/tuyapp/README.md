# Tuyapp

C++ client library for the Local Tuya API

## Description

This project is heavily based on jasonacox's Python based tinytuya project. Reason for redeveloping this in C++ is that Python is quite heavy on resources and that does not suit well with embedded machines. Also since Tuya devices from various generations do not share a common protocol there is fairly little point in trying to fit all the different protocols into a single class. If you select the wrong protocol the device will simply not respond at all and therefore this library aims to have a separate class for each of the supported protocols.

Current verified protocol versions are 3.3 and 3.4. At user request I have added a class for protocol version 3.1, however this is still in the experimental phase.

## Examples

There are several (simple) examples included in this project that show how the library can be used. Feel free to use whatever you like from these sources to build your own project using this library. Run ` make examples ` to build and check out these examples.

Additional note: since creating this library, upstream has changed the device keys from having hex numbers only to include special characters that may cause problems attempting to pass on the command line. As a result you may not be able to access some Tuya devices with the `simple_switch` and `simple_energy_monitor` examples without adding additional logic to handle escaping or encoding-decoding of those special characters. The other four examples which reference `tuya-devices.json` for the device specifications do work with the new key format.
